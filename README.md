Dynamic Elements is a JavaScript framework for building modular component-based applications. It can be used for building both web applications or Node.js applications. 

 - [The Core Framework](https://github.com/VDSFoundry/dynel-core) provides the basic building blocks of a Dynamic
   Elements application.
 - [The Data Framework](https://github.com/VDSFoundry/dynel-data) builds on the Core Framework for classes to work
   with business data, including model objects with well-defined data
   types, and collections.
 - [The UI Framework](https://github.com/VDSFoundry/dynel-ui) provides support for building UI elements for your
   web applications that can be tied to your business data.
